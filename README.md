#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic applications of engineering principles to the developments,
design, testing, and maintenance of software.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1968: Software engineering was formally recognized to address the software crisis.
1980s: Object-Oriented Programming introduced modular and reusable code.
2001: Agile methodologies emphasized flexibility and iterative development

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements
Design
Implementation
Testing
Deployment and
Maintenance

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall:
Linear: Sequential phases (requirements, design, implementation) must be completed before moving on.
Predictable: Clear timelines and costs; best for projects with stable requirements.
Example: Ideal for regulatory projects with fixed requirements.

Agile:

Iterative: Frequent updates, allowing changes even late in development.
Flexible: Adapts to evolving requirements; emphasizes collaboration.
Example: Suited for startup projects with shifting market demands.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer:
Coding: Writes and maintains code.
Problem-Solving: Fixes bugs and improves performance.
Collaboration: Works with QA and PMs to meet requirements.

QA Engineer:
Testing: Ensures software quality through testing.
Defect Tracking: Identifies and manages software issues.
Process Improvement: Suggests improvements for better quality.

Project Manager:
Planning: Sets timelines and allocates resources.
Risk Management: Identifies and mitigates project risks.
Communication: Liaises between team and stakeholders

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs:
Efficiency: Combines tools for coding, debugging, and testing.
Error Detection: Real-time feedback improves code quality.
Examples: Visual Studio, PyCharm.

VCS:
Collaboration: Tracks changes and supports team collaboration.
Version History: Allows reverting to previous code versions.
Examples: Git, SVN

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Tight Deadlines: Break work into sprints, prioritize tasks, and set realistic expectations.
Legacy Code: Refactor incrementally and improve documentation.
Tech Changes: Dedicate time for continuous learning and experimentation.
Ambiguous Requirements: Clarify early, use prototypes for alignment.
Bug Management: Prioritize critical bugs, use robust testing strategies.
Technical Debt: Regularly refactor code and update dependencies.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing: Tests individual components or functions in isolation to ensure they work correctly. Importance: Catches bugs early, 
ensuring each part functions as intended.
Integration Testing: Verifies that different modules or components work together as expected. Importance: Ensures that combined 
parts interact smoothly and correctly.
System Testing: Tests the entire system as a whole, validating that it meets specified requirements. Importance: Confirms that the 
system works as a complete and integrated product.
Acceptance Testing: Validates the software against user requirements and business needs. Importance: Ensures the software is ready 
for deployment and satisfies the end-users' expectations.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering involves crafting clear and specific instructions for AI models to generate accurate and relevant responses. 
It enhances interaction by improving accuracy, efficiency, and utility, ensuring the AI model meets user expectations

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about climate change."

Improved Prompt:
"Summarize the main causes of climate change and their impact on global temperatures."

Explanation:
The improved prompt is more specific and concise, guiding the AI to provide a focused and relevant response.
